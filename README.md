### 🌍 About Me
I’m easily fascinated by how things work, from the structure of code to the logic that holds systems together.  
I love taking ideas apart, tracing them to their core, and understanding why they behave the way they do.  
That curiosity drives everything I do, whether I’m learning, building, or debugging.

Outside of code, I spend time training, reflecting, and refining focus.  
I care about doing things with clarity and intention. I strongly care doing things with a meaning.

### ⚙️ Interests
I’m drawn to the foundations. I love exploring how systems connect, communicate and work.

- **Low-level programming** — exploring what really happens beneath abstractions  
- **Networking** — from raw protocols to secure architectures  
- **Security** — understanding vulnerabilities as deeply as defenses
